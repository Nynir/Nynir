# InfoSec Analyst / Engineer. Hobbyist Programmer.

I plan to add more tools that I think may be useful to my repositories, as well as different experiments I've undertaken for fun/exposure.

### Some other personal projects undertaken for the fun of it (not on GitHub):
- Cross-platform certificate based SSH + VNC between iOS, Windows, and Linux (also OPVN)
- VPN jump server
- Vulnerability scanning with open source tools
- Server administration (Java, vSphere, various AWS, various Azure, Ubuntu, CentOS)
- Several video games and game mods created in Java
